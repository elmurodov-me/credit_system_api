# Client and Loan Management System

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to create an API to manage clients and the loan payments control system from a fin-tech.

## Purpose

The purpose of this challenge is to test your ability to implement a solution given an abstract problem. You may find a problem in the asked task that you need to explain the problem and propose a solution to fix it.

## Problem

A fin-tech needs to create and manage the clients and keep track of the amount of money loaned and the missed/made payments. It also needs a place to retrieve the volume of outstanding debt at some point in time.

## Business Rules

- If a client contracted a loan in the past and paid all without missing any payment, you can decrease by 0.02% his tax rate.
- If a client contracted a loan in the past and paid all but missed until 3 monthly payments, you can increase by 0.04% his tax rate.
- If a client contracted a loan in the past and paid all but missed more than 3 monthly payments or didn’t pay all the loan, you need to deny the new one. 

## Limitations

Loans are paid back in monthly instalments.

## Endpoints

```json
{
    "client_id": 1,
    "amount": 1000,
    "term": 12,
    "rate": 0.05,

#### Notes

**Loan payment formula**

```
r = rate / term
instalment = [r + r / ((1 + r) ^ term - 1)] x amount
```

**Example**

For repaying a loan of $1000 at 5% interest for 12 months, the equation would be:

```
instalment = [(0.05 / 12) + (0.05 / 12) / ((1 + (0.05 / 12)) ^ 12 - 1] x 1000
instalment = 85.60  
```
